Some of the most important problems are being tackled in academic biology labs. They seem like a suitable <a href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Effective_system_design_requires_insights_drawn_from_serious_contexts_of_use\">serious context of use</a> to invent powerful new representations and tools and help improve public health.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sashachapin/status/1453423907898232836?s=21\">https://twitter.com/sashachapin/status/1453423907898232836?s=21</a></p>\n<p>I'm considering reaching out to bio labs across the country and volunteering (for a small stipend) to be a \"resident toolbuilder\". Not just to solve immediate digital problems for the lab but to examine and improve their processes and accessibility for everyone. Perhaps down the road I can generalize one lab's tooling into a more universal platform (<a href=\"/inquiry/notes/c3d1d432-1ebd-4805-8a16-a0eadfcaf329\">Figma for Science</a>).</p>\n<p>Two caveats to look out for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \"faster horse\" problem: will labs be biased towards conventional tools and just want me to do plumbing? Assuming plumbing is actually the biggest bottleneck, maybe I can do something to improve productivity there. Do they even know what they need in general? It would be best if I could observe (a la <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691028323/laboratory-life\">Laboratory Life</a>) what they're doing and act from there, using my own imagination.</li>\n<li>Accruing technical debt: I don't want to leave the lab in more of a mess than it started, with rapidly-rotting bespoke frontends that will end up in the trash quickly. Ideally I build an oeuvre that is either very easy for the lab to maintain, or is so cohesive and compelling that I can maintain it myself as a \"platform\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general I'm becoming more biased in favor of building for \"hard tech\" for urgent problems in the world (I resonated with <a href=\"https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2021_01_important_work/\">Kevin Lynagh's post</a> on important work). Effective altruism is another realm I'm adjacent to and very much a supporter of.</p>\n<p>I incidentally discovered <a href=\"https://postlight.com/podcast/computing-is-everywhere\">Bret Victor considered</a> going this route early in his career:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I saw climate change as this crisis and one of the most important things to work on. And I’d — I’d tried to work directly on that in certain ways and realized that I just didn’t really have the kind of temperment for going really deep on a scientific problem. I was more of a toolmaker. I wanted to make tools that enabled other people to rally other people in the problem. Even before Apple I had come up with this plan of, “Well, I wanna make this really powerful scientific tool. I don’t really know enough of how science is practiced. And so I’m going to like travel around the country, spending a month at a different scie — a different lab um every month. Just kind of offering myself as like, “I’m a free toolmaker, use me how you will.” And then thereby kind of get — get the experience of um after a year of like, “Oh here’s the sorts of needs that scientists have and here is the super tool that I can make.” That plan didn’t really get off the ground because um it turns out I’m not really social enough to reach out to people actively like that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I went through this period of traveling around and kind of coming up with these themes. But in the process of doing that, I uh — a team of scientists at um at Georgia Tech and um did some prototyping with them. And the structures that I came up with and the enthusiasm that they had for them made me think, kinda go back to that, “Hey, I really wanna make a tool for scientists. I wanna make a new MatLab or a cross between MatLab and Garageband.” And so that was um I’ve never admitted this publicly before but that was kind of my — my major project for like the next year or two after that was I was making this um this new scientific tool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s hard to have the level of motivation to pull off something really huge like that, if you don’t have the right support structures in place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/\">https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://newscience.org/how-software-in-the-life-sciences-actually-works-and-doesnt-work/\">https://newscience.org/how-software-in-the-life-sciences-actually-works-and-doesnt-work/</a></p>\n<p>Fun random example: Chaim Gingold &#x26; Shawn Douglas's <a href=\"https://douglaslab.org/gelbox/\">Gelbox</a></p>\n<p>Related: <a href=\"/inquiry/notes/c3d1d432-1ebd-4805-8a16-a0eadfcaf329\">Figma for Science</a></p>\n<p>Kevin suggests commercial labs \"get more done\" - just a matter of being good about IP transfer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1069422308526239744\">https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1069422308526239744</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArtirKel/status/1505284608971083779\">https://twitter.com/ArtirKel/status/1505284608971083779</a></p>\n<p>Consultancy with lab clients <a href=\"https://latticeautomation.com/\">https://latticeautomation.com/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/inquiry/notes/nNa3zYBGRPLYKY6c2N21j\">Context Immersion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/inquiry/notes/86Sf5BfBEjs3PqSBrucXe\">IDE/Photoshop/DAW for X</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","title":"Max's Inquiry","updated":1616115341623,"modified":"2022-08-26T16:46:41.000Z","desc":null,"custom":{"modified":"2022-08-26T16:46:41.000Z","nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"7936220386f369ace243d8e835153790","created":1695797153867,"links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet","alias":"Linear algebra as spreadsheet","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":3,"offset":949},"end":{"line":16,"column":72,"offset":1018},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"rethinking-media.microworld-languages","alias":"Domain learning for computational microworlds","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":1021},"end":{"line":17,"column":90,"offset":1108},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"rethinking-media.microworld-languages"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"projects.linux-desktop","alias":"Linux DE prototyping","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":1111},"end":{"line":18,"column":50,"offset":1158},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"projects.linux-desktop"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"projects.system-archaeology","alias":"System Archaeology","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":1161},"end":{"line":19,"column":53,"offset":1211},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"projects.system-archaeology"}}],"anchors":{"guide":{"type":"header","text":"Guide","value":"guide","line":19,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["2e6e45b5-be90-4ef3-8720-6e52ce04cb9a","5988f8ec-c945-458a-8309-9f318af16602","86c66ea6-63bc-4711-8eff-13bb9260db4f","d8a51d81-83c8-45b4-84fa-9b55dce793ac"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nThis is [Max Krieger](https://a9.io)'s \"inquiry\" page.
