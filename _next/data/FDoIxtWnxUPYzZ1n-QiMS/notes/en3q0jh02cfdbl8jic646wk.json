(Yes the color matters, but I‚Äôll get back to that.) These props, and the ways we use them, come from restorative and yin yoga. Restorative yoga is an approach to yoga asanas (poses) which works directly with the nervous system, promoting feelings of safety and security by supporting every joint in the body and using verbal cues to encourage deep relaxation. Yin yoga uses the same poses but with different emphasis. The goal in yin is to elongate connective tissue. Connective tissue is everything from bones to joint capsules to the honeycomb of endomysium which surrounds and gives structure to every muscle cell in a vast continuous network. Unlike the muscle fibers themselves which are elastic (bounce-baFck-fulness) connective tissue is plastic (stretch-ableness) which means that it will change shape with any low intensity, long duration position. You are already doing connective tissue modifying things everyday. If you use a laptop or phone you are familiar with hunch pose. Long exposures accentuate the kyphotic curve in upper spine (rounding the shoulders and ribs forward) and the lordodic curve in the neck (jutting the head forward). Blech. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ok Now we have covered the floor, the props, and the bodies let‚Äôs zoom out to the larger room then zoom in to software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The floor you are on, the furniture you use, the design of the software, but also where you wear influences the experience you have in a headset. Where and how our VR play space is situated was inspired half by necessity and half by the ‚Äòwomb with a view‚Äô concept from home design I learned from Winifred Gallagher‚Äôs book House Thinking (Thanks Margaret for the recommendation!). Gallagher describes a framework for building living spaces that ‚Äúimprove[s] our lives and perhaps even our mental health‚Äù by balancing 5 components: prospect, refuge, enticement, peril, and complex order. If they can make a home feel homier why can‚Äôt they make a studio feel safe and playful? Safe-at-home is exactly the feeling a VR space needs because as Gallagher points out ‚ÄúSafe at home, we even enjoy perilous heights and pay extra for dramatic views, balconies, and staircases to prove it.‚Äù VR‚Äôs perilous heights included.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But while all these changes in environment and furniture and behavior can dramatically improve the experience of wearing, it must be met by software designed for the same union of mobility and stability. It‚Äôs this environment, not the swively present, ya‚Äôll should be testing in. A simple example: What makes the Youtube Daydream app better than the Netflix one? Youtube enables users to position the focal point anywhere. Netflix choose a fixed focal point that can‚Äôt accommodate many of these postures. It‚Äôs haunted by the specter of that swivel chair. Fixed focal point is üìÇdesktop metaphor, the old way. Variable focal point is üé®studio metaphor, the new way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170716041546/http://elevr.com/the-office-of-the-future\">https://web.archive.org/web/20170716041546/http://elevr.com/the-office-of-the-future</a>)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I love the foam blocks+yoga mat language.

I guess it's like a [Digital Garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). But I'm not trying to upload my Second Brain to it. Just want to share some half-baked ideas. One source of inspiration for this was Kevin Lynagh's [\"Collaboration ideas\"](https://kevinlynagh.com/ideas/). See also Sharif Shameem's [\"Questions\"](https://sharif.io/questions/).\n\nIt was made with [Dendron](https://dendron.so).\n\nTake everything I write here (well, everywhere) with a grain of salt. That said I'm always happy to talk about anything on here.\n\nThe pages definitely don't adhere to [Andy's Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) pattern, I hope one day they do.\n\nFeel free to add [a PR or issue to the repo](https://github.com/maxkrieger/inquiry) to discuss any of these in public!\n\n## Guide\n\nHere are some of my favorite/extensive pages:\n\n- [[Linear algebra as spreadsheet|projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet]]\n- [[Domain learning for computational microworlds|rethinking-media.microworld-languages]]\n- [[Linux DE prototyping|projects.linux-desktop]]\n- [[System Archaeology|projects.system-archaeology]]\n\n---\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-03-18-20-55-10.png)\n\n[El Lissitzky, The Constructor (self-portrait, 1924)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:El_Lissitzky_The_Constructor,_self-portrait,_gelatin_silver_print,_107%C3%97118_mm,_1924_London,_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum,_Inv._PH142-1985.jpg)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.87.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Max's Inquiry","description":"max's inquiry wiki"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"assetsPrefix":"/inquiry","siteUrl":"https://a9.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
