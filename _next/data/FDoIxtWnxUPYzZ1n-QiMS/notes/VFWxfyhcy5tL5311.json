Its failure seemed to be from not arriving at a compelling MVP from the myriad prototypes they explored. It's been a long time since I watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThjFFDwOXok\">against the current</a> but there's a lot to unpack there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sokpop-games\">Sokpop Games<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#sokpop-games\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://sokpop.co/\">Sokpop</a> <em>prototypes as a virtue</em>. All of their games are small and incomplete but explore ambitious ideas. All of them are seedlings that could hatch into blockbusters. Their <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/sokpop\">Patreon</a> is currently supporting monthly game-prototypes, all playable.</p>\n<p>I'm particularly enamored by Sokpop because they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explore new interaction paradigms casually. The games often explore fundamental new modes of interaction and bend genres.</li>\n<li>Are aesthetically innovative. All the sokpop games are gorgeous and have a distinctive \"house style\". Prototypes are a way to whittle in house style!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"creative-selection\">Creative Selection<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#creative-selection\"></a></h2>\n<p>Kocienda describes in his book a process of <em>creative selection</em>, where core interactions on the iPhone were made possible through a quick process of demoing to higher-ups, forming tight feedback loops.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","title":"Max's Inquiry","updated":1616115341623,"modified":"2022-08-26T16:46:41.000Z","desc":null,"custom":{"modified":"2022-08-26T16:46:41.000Z","nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"7936220386f369ace243d8e835153790","created":1695797153867,"links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet","alias":"Linear algebra as spreadsheet","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":3,"offset":949},"end":{"line":16,"column":72,"offset":1018},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"rethinking-media.microworld-languages","alias":"Domain learning for computational microworlds","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":1021},"end":{"line":17,"column":90,"offset":1108},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"rethinking-media.microworld-languages"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"projects.linux-desktop","alias":"Linux DE prototyping","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":1111},"end":{"line":18,"column":50,"offset":1158},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"projects.linux-desktop"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"940ad93a-2b54-497e-ab18-335879950834","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"projects.system-archaeology","alias":"System Archaeology","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":1161},"end":{"line":19,"column":53,"offset":1211},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"projects.system-archaeology"}}],"anchors":{"guide":{"type":"header","text":"Guide","value":"guide","line":19,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["2e6e45b5-be90-4ef3-8720-6e52ce04cb9a","5988f8ec-c945-458a-8309-9f318af16602","86c66ea6-63bc-4711-8eff-13bb9260db4f","d8a51d81-83c8-45b4-84fa-9b55dce793ac"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nThis is [Max Krieger](https://a9.io)'s \"inquiry\" page.
