Encoding domain knowledge into a photoshop/IDE-like interface (a la [[rethinking-media.microworld-languages]], [[projects.figma-science]], [[projects.figma-science.dsp-notebook]], [[projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet]])

> ... there are some very deep ideas about image manipulation, which had been built directly into Photoshop. By contrast, there’s not really very many deep ideas about writing built into Microsoft Word.
