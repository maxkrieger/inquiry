<p>I was astonished by the mode of interacting in Self's <a href="https://handbook.selflanguage.org/2017.1/morphic.html">Morphic environment</a>, demonstrated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774">Self: The Movie;</a>.</p>
<p>You create a green, empty "morph" on a 2D plane, and then right-click it to open a context menu <a href="/inquiry/notes/bff6ee82-45d7-4702-bb59-542b05920ae9">How do you create an interaction semantics?</a>, where you can assign behavior:

<p>You can decompose any piece of content and rearrange it, <a href="/inquiry/notes/4a69ebf0-4af7-4e56-b4c5-5e9dbd633d32">Bricolage</a>-style.</p>

<p>What does this kind of environment look like if implemented today? GToolkit is cool. SqueakJS is cool. Figma for Smalltalk!? (<a href="/inquiry/notes/f2d1c8a1-5bb9-4cd6-816c-afe6ea86935a">Figma for X</a>)</p>
<p>What if the morphs were more jelly/<a href="/inquiry/notes/8696586c-2cfc-47a2-b483-e1e6be539a20">metaball</a>-like?</p>
<p>Programming in 2D is only making a comeback recently (eg some of the projects in <a href="/inquiry/notes/06ea3d39-0b83-4052-86f2-f1e82499b266">Linear Algebra as Spreadsheet</a> like Paul Shen's)</p>

<p>Another system by Randall Smith is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9LZ6TnSP40">Alternate Reality Kit</a></p>
<p>Also Dan Ingalls' <a href="https://lively-web.org/">Lively-Web</a>, which isn't quite as performant or rich as I'd want - similar to Omar's sentiment on Smalltalk above.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/codefrau">Vanessa Freudenberg</a>/Croquet Team is a good person to talk to about this.</p>
