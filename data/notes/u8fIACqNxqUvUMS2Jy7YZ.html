<p>I want to recapitulate the thinking that went into any large git repo. It's not enough to just scrub the history of a single file or see the files abstractly (cf Gource).</p>
<p>Something more like <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkriegers/status/1467251550095491074">https://twitter.com/maxkriegers/status/1467251550095491074</a> but over time. The files folding on top of each other. Chunks transferring to separate files and abstractions made. Semantic edits. Diffs but meaningful.</p>
