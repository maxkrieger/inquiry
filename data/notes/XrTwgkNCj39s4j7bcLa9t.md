- [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) works poorly for most serious synthesis/domain-specific tasks.
- Hypothesis: non text editor environments are where codex will excel

### Like:

- Cell/Node-Based Environments where functions are compact and contexts are specified in a structured way
  - Blockly?
- Strongly typed languages where type annotations specify a lot
- Define sprites/assets/params, then ask for game behavior in prose, then iterate
- Well-specified primitives/standard libraries
  - Numpy/OpenCV - "solve for" operations in data pipelines
  - Autodiff
