<p>To prototype fast or slow? There are plenty of better reflections on this I haven't looked into.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting examples of rapidity:</p>
<h2 id="eve">Eve<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#eve"></a></h2>
<p>Before Eve fizzled out, it made many <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/essays/eve/">rapid prototypes</a> all exploring provocative new forms of programming. Its failure seemed to be from not arriving at a compelling MVP from the myriad prototypes they explored. It's been a long time since I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThjFFDwOXok">against the current</a> but there's a lot to unpack there.</p>
<h2 id="sokpop-games">Sokpop Games<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sokpop-games"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://sokpop.co/">Sokpop</a> <em>prototypes as a virtue</em>. All of their games are small and incomplete but explore ambitious ideas. All of them are seedlings that could hatch into blockbusters. Their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sokpop">Patreon</a> is currently supporting monthly game-prototypes, all playable.</p>
<p>I'm particularly enamored by Sokpop because they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore new interaction paradigms casually. The games often explore fundamental new modes of interaction and bend genres.</li>
<li>Are aesthetically innovative. All the sokpop games are gorgeous and have a distinctive "house style". Prototypes are a way to whittle in house style!</li>
</ul>

<p>Kocienda describes in his book a process of <em>creative selection</em>, where core interactions on the iPhone were made possible through a quick process of demoing to higher-ups, forming tight feedback loops.</p>
