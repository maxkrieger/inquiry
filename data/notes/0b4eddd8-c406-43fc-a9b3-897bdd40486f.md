I was astonished by the mode of interacting in Self's [Morphic environment](https://handbook.selflanguage.org/2017.1/morphic.html), demonstrated in [Self: The Movie;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774).

You create a green, empty "morph" on a 2D plane, and then right-click it to open a context menu [[theory.interaction-semantics]], where you can assign behavior:

You can decompose any piece of content and rearrange it, [[theory.bricolage]]-style.

It's even realtime multiplayer in the local network!

What does this kind of environment look like if implemented today? GToolkit is cool. SqueakJS is cool. Figma for Smalltalk!? ([[theory.figma-for-x]])

What if the morphs were more jelly/[[metaball|theory.metaballs]]-like?

Programming in 2D is only making a comeback recently (eg some of the projects in [[projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet]] like Paul Shen's)

Another system by Randall Smith is [Alternate Reality Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9LZ6TnSP40)

Also Dan Ingalls' [Lively-Web](https://lively-web.org/), which isn't quite as performant or rich as I'd want - similar to Omar's sentiment on Smalltalk above.

[Vanessa Freudenberg](https://twitter.com/codefrau)/Croquet Team is a good person to talk to about this.
