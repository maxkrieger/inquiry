“Babel club”

* The best book on a shelf/in an aisle
* The most esoteric / sci-fi sounding book
* The book with the most magical incantations
* Best phrase
* Best diagram
* Guess the title and subject of this book based on this page I'm showing you
* Guess the genre of a given shelf that you got blindfolded to go to
* Bring back something cool you have 30 minutes

### Research directed prompts

Given only the dewey-floor mapping index (a brochure available in the lobby), find N books that answer:

* Assemble a list of essential knowledge for a hypothetical society (foundation/post apocalyptic) / “pick 5 books to rebuild society/on a tropical island”
* Researching to write a film with X premise
* Teaching an alien who speaks English how to pretend to be a human

Better results when you integrate multiple disciplines!

—-


- Coffee table/large format books are great to read together, wide viewing angle
- Do this stuff in groups/teams so you don’t unshelve too many books for the librarians to put back
- Focusing on textbooks might be interesting

* need to mark book slot locations to put the books back



Need to google “things to do at the library”
