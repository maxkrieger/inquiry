To prototype fast or slow? There are plenty of better reflections on this I haven't looked into.

Here are some interesting examples of rapidity:

## Eve

Before Eve fizzled out, it made many [rapid prototypes](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/eve/) all exploring provocative new forms of programming. Its failure seemed to be from not arriving at a compelling MVP from the myriad prototypes they explored. It's been a long time since I watched [against the current](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThjFFDwOXok) but there's a lot to unpack there.

## Sokpop Games

[Sokpop](https://sokpop.co/) _prototypes as a virtue_. All of their games are small and incomplete but explore ambitious ideas. All of them are seedlings that could hatch into blockbusters. Their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sokpop) is currently supporting monthly game-prototypes, all playable.

I'm particularly enamored by Sokpop because they:

- Explore new interaction paradigms casually. The games often explore fundamental new modes of interaction and bend genres.
- Are aesthetically innovative. All the sokpop games are gorgeous and have a distinctive "house style". Prototypes are a way to whittle in house style!

## Creative Selection

Kocienda describes in his book a process of _creative selection_, where core interactions on the iPhone were made possible through a quick process of demoing to higher-ups, forming tight feedback loops.
