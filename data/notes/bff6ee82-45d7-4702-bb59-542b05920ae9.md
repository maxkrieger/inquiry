Programming semantics are well-studied. What about direct manipulation semantics? Can they be [in bijection](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1227791682038452225)?

I'm especially interested in, say, reflecting mathematical semantics in interactive diagrams. With [Penrose](https://penrose.ink), we've been asking, eg, what dragging a point outside a circle in a venn diagram means mathematically - it's an "edit" in the mathematical construction.

This is true for other domains that have a formal representation underlying a highly interactive one.

## Direct manipulation (mouse, not keyboard)

What even is a program? You can make great Smalltalk ([[projects.system-archaeology]]) programs without writing much code at all. I'm not talking about [no-code/future-code](https://futureofcoding.org/catalog/), but rather, _writing a trace of behavior_ by _live_ (not premeditated) interactions on objects.
