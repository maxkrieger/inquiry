Hackathons have become decadent even before COVID-19 shut them down.

The abstract model of "bring talent together for a paid-for summit" is certainly an interesting one, though. "Unconferences" seems like the wrong term for this, especially since they're often not free to attend. "Retreats" come closer but don't imply any _building_ will happen.

Corporate sponsors might be willing to experiment with new kinds of events. What about weekend/weeklong retreats? Probably have to get lucky with booking, or find a mechanism to co-host it with a group house.
