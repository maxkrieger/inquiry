<p>I want to be able to take a screenshot of the whiteboard in a Ninja Nerd lecture—a big beautiful diagram of the players in the adaptive immune system—and lasso sections of it, linking to sub-diagrams, some filled in by me, some by others, illustrating each of the parts in turn. We should have big, collaboratively edited zoomable “maps”—hierarchical diagrams—that are easy to navigate, work in standard browsers, are embeddable in blog posts, and so on.</p>
