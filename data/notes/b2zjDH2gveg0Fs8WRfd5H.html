<p>Watching YouTube with friends on the couch, with a shared queue, is a magical experience. It’s more conducive to short form braindead/funny stuff than long form research/thinky content though.</p>
<p>How can the watch party of a lecture etc be made more engaging/interactive without interrupting the flow of the content?</p>
<p>I think realtime bookmarking could be a start. Everyone's phone (or a more mindful device) has a button that saves the timestamp, and the timestamps are aggregated afterwards into a montage of clips for discussion.</p>
<p>Maybe there are ways to detect good breaks/intermissions. After a threshold of bookmark saturation?</p>
