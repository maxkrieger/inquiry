<p>For nearly a year I've been struggling to build a prototype, solo, what I outlined in <a href="https://a9.io/glue-comic">Chatting with Glue</a>.</p>
<p>So I'm making an intermediate prototype (<a href="/inquiry/notes/688f0aa8-338b-424e-abb2-d6067e7fae5e">Downscoping as a skill (subprojecting)</a>) without the hard parts (privacy, authentication, notifications), using a lightweight realtime database. It'll resemble a chat app but will nominally be a collaborative outliner tool. For meeting notes (<a href="/inquiry/notes/1d0d9bf0-f059-476a-842a-0dc747ec2b85">Better Meetings</a>) and such.</p>
<p>Word processing and whiteboarding are the wrong metaphors for shared info accretion during a call. You're always worrying about layout and overwriting the other person's thoughts. Need atomicity.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Why is this better than Slack etc?</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinite threading, inline quotation/embellishment <em>does matter</em>, and it matters a ton. It's a whole other mode of thinking (hypothesis)</li>
<li>Messages are more malleable/data-like when they're collapsible. Legible more as an outline, a document, a record
<ul>
<li>It doesn't replace Slack, it's another product category</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let's find out if it is empirically!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if each chat "workspace" originated with a chat message on the homescreen? The homescreen is a private scratchpad and you can share messages and their descendants with people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline hashtags/mentions are crucial, with autocomplete for them to invite accretion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Copy-paste handling needs to be next-level. Drag and drop. It should be as good as a finder window (a la <a href="/inquiry/notes/37OcxJWLvRCT3Q8qGB56Y">ChatFS</a>)</p>
