A figma plugin to position a hand puppet on top of some artboard, manipulating it.

Make anything look tangible. Take a pic of some abstract structure, configure hand pose by choosing where the fingers go, then the plugin projects the hands reaching toward the plane of the pic.

Similar effect to the scale figure people in architectural drafts
