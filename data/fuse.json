Some of the most important problems are being tackled in academic biology labs. They seem like a suitable [serious context of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Effective_system_design_requires_insights_drawn_from_serious_contexts_of_use) to invent powerful new representations and tools and help improve public health.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sashachapin/status/1453423907898232836?s=21\n\nI'm considering reaching out to bio labs across the country and volunteering (for a small stipend) to be a \"resident toolbuilder\". Not just to solve immediate digital problems for the lab but to examine and improve their processes and accessibility for everyone. Perhaps down the road I can generalize one lab's tooling into a more universal platform ([[projects.figma-science]]).\n\nTwo caveats to look out for:\n\n- The \"faster horse\" problem: will labs be biased towards conventional tools and just want me to do plumbing? Assuming plumbing is actually the biggest bottleneck, maybe I can do something to improve productivity there. Do they even know what they need in general? It would be best if I could observe (a la [Laboratory Life](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691028323/laboratory-life)) what they're doing and act from there, using my own imagination.\n- Accruing technical debt: I don't want to leave the lab in more of a mess than it started, with rapidly-rotting bespoke frontends that will end up in the trash quickly. Ideally I build an oeuvre that is either very easy for the lab to maintain, or is so cohesive and compelling that I can maintain it myself as a \"platform\".\n\nIn general I'm becoming more biased in favor of building for \"hard tech\" for urgent problems in the world (I resonated with [Kevin Lynagh's post](https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2021_01_important_work/) on important work). Effective altruism is another realm I'm adjacent to and very much a supporter of.\n\nI incidentally discovered [Bret Victor considered](https://postlight.com/podcast/computing-is-everywhere) going this route early in his career:\n\n> I saw climate change as this crisis and one of the most important things to work on. And I’d — I’d tried to work directly on that in certain ways and realized that I just didn’t really have the kind of temperment for going really deep on a scientific problem. I was more of a toolmaker. I wanted to make tools that enabled other people to rally other people in the problem. Even before Apple I had come up with this plan of, “Well, I wanna make this really powerful scientific tool. I don’t really know enough of how science is practiced. And so I’m going to like travel around the country, spending a month at a different scie — a different lab um every month. Just kind of offering myself as like, “I’m a free toolmaker, use me how you will.” And then thereby kind of get — get the experience of um after a year of like, “Oh here’s the sorts of needs that scientists have and here is the super tool that I can make.” That plan didn’t really get off the ground because um it turns out I’m not really social enough to reach out to people actively like that.\n\n> I went through this period of traveling around and kind of coming up with these themes. But in the process of doing that, I uh — a team of scientists at um at Georgia Tech and um did some prototyping with them. And the structures that I came up with and the enthusiasm that they had for them made me think, kinda go back to that, “Hey, I really wanna make a tool for scientists. I wanna make a new MatLab or a cross between MatLab and Garageband.” And so that was um I’ve never admitted this publicly before but that was kind of my — my major project for like the next year or two after that was I was making this um this new scientific tool.\n\n> It’s hard to have the level of motivation to pull off something really huge like that, if you don’t have the right support structures in place.\n\nhttps://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/\n\nhttps://newscience.org/how-software-in-the-life-sciences-actually-works-and-doesnt-work/\n\nFun random example: Chaim Gingold & Shawn Douglas's [Gelbox](https://douglaslab.org/gelbox/)\n\nRelated: [[projects.figma-science]]\n\nKevin suggests commercial labs \"get more done\" - just a matter of being good about IP transfer.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/patio11/status/1069422308526239744\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArtirKel/status/1505284608971083779\n\nConsultancy with lab clients https://latticeautomation.com/\n","n":0.039}}},{"i":6,"$":{"0":{"v":"Quick Capture Is Under-Explored","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\nI have a tricorder in my pocket.

They destroy existing abstractions. And they're fast and delightful.\n\nThis means no Webkit, Electron, or V8.\n\nEvanw's [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/faq/#why-is-esbuild-fast):\n\n> **Everything in esbuild is written from scratch.**\n> There are a lot of performance benefits with writing everything yourself instead of using 3rd-party libraries. You can have performance in mind from the beginning, you can make sure everything uses consistent data structures to avoid expensive conversions, and you can make wide architectural changes whenever necessary. The drawback is of course that it's a lot of work.\n> For example, many bundlers use the official TypeScript compiler as a parser. But it was built to serve the goals of the TypeScript compiler team and they do not have performance as a top priority. Their code makes pretty heavy use of megamorphic object shapes and unnecessary dynamic property accesses (both well-known JavaScript speed bumps). And the TypeScript parser appears to still run the type checker even when type checking is disabled. None of these are an issue with esbuild's custom TypeScript parser.\n\n## Some systems\n\n- [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)\n- [Xi Editor](https://raphlinus.github.io/xi/2020/06/27/xi-retrospective.html) (RIP?)\n- [Volt](https://volt-app.com/) (and [V language](https://vlang.io/))\n- [Ripcord](https://cancel.fm/ripcord/)\n- [**Playbit**](https://playb.it/) - [podcast episode](https://museapp.com/podcast/27-playful-software/)\n- [Nova](https://nova.app/) - no Vim emulation? wtf!\n- [Neovim?](https://neovim.io/)\n- Raft (vs Paxos)\n\n**Observation**: Rewrites of large systems by tiny teams are powerful. Conway's law and all that.\n\nIn general, if something's rewritten in Go or Rust, it's probably faster. Not necessarily because the language is faster (Go is garbage collected!) but because the languages provide the clarity of thought needed to redesign a system, safely, from scratch.\n\nGreat counterpoint to this: Joel Spolsky calls rewrites a “[thing you should never do](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)” because code is not a physical object. It doesn’t get rusty or get clean. While you might have more clarity the second time around, you won’t necessarily have fewer bugs or time consumed. There’s no a priori reason rewrites are good, it’s mostly aesthetic.\n\n## What about virtualization?\n\nJVM, Graal, Flutter/WASM??\n\nSee also [[projects.linux-desktop]]\n\n## Misc\n\nDart, Vala, Kotlin\n\n[Lunatic](https://lunatic.solutions/): an Erlang-inspired runtime for WebAssembly\n\n\n[[theory.bottom-up]]\n","n":0.055}}},{"i":25,"$":{"0":{"v":"Context Immersion","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nHow do you find a [Serious context of use?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Effective_system_design_requires_insights_drawn_from_serious_contexts_of_use)?\n\n[[theory.resident]]\n\nKanjun (paraphrased): Idea-seeking is less powerful than context-seeking\n\nEthnography/fieldwork can be considered \"context immersion\", but it isn't normative.

(Yes the color matters, but I’ll get back to that.) These props, and the ways we use them, come from restorative and yin yoga. Restorative yoga is an approach to yoga asanas (poses) which works directly with the nervous system, promoting feelings of safety and security by supporting every joint in the body and using verbal cues to encourage deep relaxation. Yin yoga uses the same poses but with different emphasis. The goal in yin is to elongate connective tissue. Connective tissue is everything from bones to joint capsules to the honeycomb of endomysium which surrounds and gives structure to every muscle cell in a vast continuous network. Unlike the muscle fibers themselves which are elastic (bounce-baFck-fulness) connective tissue is plastic (stretch-ableness) which means that it will change shape with any low intensity, long duration position. You are already doing connective tissue modifying things everyday. If you use a laptop or phone you are familiar with hunch pose. Long exposures accentuate the kyphotic curve in upper spine (rounding the shoulders and ribs forward) and the lordodic curve in the neck (jutting the head forward). Blech. [...]\n\n> Ok Now we have covered the floor, the props, and the bodies let’s zoom out to the larger room then zoom in to software.\n\n> The floor you are on, the furniture you use, the design of the software, but also where you wear influences the experience you have in a headset. Where and how our VR play space is situated was inspired half by necessity and half by the ‘womb with a view’ concept from home design I learned from Winifred Gallagher’s book House Thinking (Thanks Margaret for the recommendation!). Gallagher describes a framework for building living spaces that “improve[s] our lives and perhaps even our mental health” by balancing 5 components: prospect, refuge, enticement, peril, and complex order. If they can make a home feel homier why can’t they make a studio feel safe and playful? Safe-at-home is exactly the feeling a VR space needs because as Gallagher points out “Safe at home, we even enjoy perilous heights and pay extra for dramatic views, balconies, and staircases to prove it.” VR’s perilous heights included.\n\n> But while all these changes in environment and furniture and behavior can dramatically improve the experience of wearing, it must be met by software designed for the same union of mobility and stability. It’s this environment, not the swively present, ya’ll should be testing in. A simple example: What makes the Youtube Daydream app better than the Netflix one? Youtube enables users to position the focal point anywhere. Netflix choose a fixed focal point that can’t accommodate many of these postures. It’s haunted by the specter of that swivel chair. Fixed focal point is 📂desktop metaphor, the old way. Variable focal point is 🎨studio metaphor, the new way.\n\n(https://web.archive.org/web/20170716041546/http://elevr.com/the-office-of-the-future)\n\n---\n\nI love the foam blocks+yoga mat language.

Particularly early on, you may not be able to articulate the new element you’re reaching for very clearly. It may just sound like an unusual adverb choice or an innocuous-seeming qualifier. Others’ replies will tend to emphasize the most mainstream elements, since they may not notice or know how to react to the aspects you least understand. Such conversation will often drag you back towards the mainstream. It’s a kind of “regression to the mean” for ideas.\n\n> Great colleagues and collaborators can take more active steps to mitigate the issue. For instance, if Michael hears me talking about some idea that seems fairly banal on the surface, he’ll deliberately tug at the vague spots where I’m straining to reach past typical interpretations. This was part of a broader practice he called “listening for enablement.” My Khan Academy research colleague May-Li Khoe would respond to my poorly-understood ideas by riffing in unpredictable directions.

In fact, undergraduates are instructed to scan the figures in a paper _before_ reading the content.\n\nSee also: [Unflattening](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674744431)\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis is something I'm always open for advice on.\n\n### Cola-Web\n\n**Main idea**: Use cola's constraints to prevent overlaps between boxes and apply grouping.\n\n**Blocker**: Weird behavior when several boxes in a row are smooshed right now. Unclear API.\n\n### Bezier eccentricities:\n\n**Main idea**: change a snake-shaped bezier curve as browser resizes.\n\n**Blocker**: math. Currently figuring this out.\n\n## Misc\n\n- [A Comic Introduction to Idyll](https://mathisonian.github.io/idyll-comic/) uses Grid, through and through\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve been working on a dead simple way to make websites. <br><br>Drag-and-drop, free-form, collage-like. <a href=\"https://t.co/FhiJZO3Mu2\">pic.twitter.com/FhiJZO3Mu2</a></p>&mdash; HX (@ntsphx) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ntsphx/status/1363747307129212929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n## Nonfiction comics\n\n- Unflattening\n- dynamicland zine\n- Soupergreen\n- Artful design\n\n## Existing\n\n- mmm.page\n- https://fffuel.co/ uses tailwind primitives\n\n—-\n\nhttps://www.nema.org/docs/default-source/advocacy-document-library/nema_chutesandladder_2017_revised-4web.pdf\n\nhttps://twitter.com/pomber/status/1576913357030199298?s=46&t=JmKdb7lCuFQ6Q22GTMiYrQ\n\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[better-reading]: better-reading.md \"Reading, but good\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n","n":0.053}}},{"i":69,"$":{"0":{"v":"Figma for Science","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n![](/assets/images/2021-04-06-23-36-23.png)\n\n[Avivator](https://twitter.com/ngehlenborg/status/1293899072617807874/photo/1)\n\nThere might be a big startup opportunity with porting old, widely used scientific tools to the web with Figma-like realtime annotation and rendering capabilities.\n\nScientific tooling is old but collaboration's more important than ever.\n\nRealtime thinking is important.
