I don't know much about organic chemistry, but I should. I wish I didn't have to have taken Organic Chemistry in college to appreciate its vastness and beauty (like linear algebra, it has a disempowering syllabus divorced from its context - [[projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet]]). A _Mathematician's Lament_ type problem (cf https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/).

Surely there's a need for an environment for, say, drawing skeletal diagrams, but more dynamic and authorial ([[theory.ide-for-x]]). Where you can combine elements from a palette until you recapitulate ideas like those NileRed conveys so elegantly in his absurd transmutation videos?

Synthesis pathways unfolding before you, etc

I was hopeful that [Crash Course's OChem course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtONguuhLdVmq0HTKS0jksS4) would have enough eye-catching motion graphics to keep me awake, but alas, at many points it felt like a powerpoint with the same flaws in the medium as any other video.
