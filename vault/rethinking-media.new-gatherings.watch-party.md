Watching YouTube with friends on the couch, with a shared queue, is a magical experience. It’s more conducive to short form braindead/funny stuff than long form research/thinky content though.

How can the watch party of a lecture etc be made more engaging/interactive without interrupting the flow of the content?

I think realtime bookmarking could be a start. Everyone's phone (or a more mindful device) has a button that saves the timestamp, and the timestamps are aggregated afterwards into a montage of clips for discussion.

Andrés describes Nintendo Switch's [retroactive clipping](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-Switch/FAQ/How-to-Capture-and-Edit-Gameplay-Video-1294570.html) feature where you hold the button to increase the clip duration.
