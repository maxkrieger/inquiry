How can the watch party (of a lecture etc) be made more engaging/interactive without interrupting the flow of the content?

I think realtime bookmarking could be a start. Everyone's phone (or a more mindful device) has a button that saves the timestamp, and the timestamps are aggregated afterwards into a montage of clips for discussion.
