[[theory.quick-capture]].

Discord audio calls should have a listener-bot that transcribes/records the last 30 seconds when you ask it to. Maybe it hallucinates and whispers stuff too during the call (need a whispering TTS pls).

When you send a link while talking, bot sends a clip for context. Maybe encode as mp4 if there’s no quick-preview for mp3

Constraint: voice bots don’t work in private chats, just servers
