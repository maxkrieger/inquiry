I want to recapitulate the thinking that went into any large git repo. It's not enough to just scrub the history of a single file or see the files abstractly (cf Gource).

Something more like https://twitter.com/maxkriegers/status/1467251550095491074 but over time. The files folding on top of each other. Semantic edits.
