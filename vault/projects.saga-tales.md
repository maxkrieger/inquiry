For nearly a year I've been struggling to build a prototype, solo, what I outlined in [Chatting with Glue](https://a9.io/glue-comic).

So I'm making an intermediate prototype ([[theory.subprojecting]]) without the hard parts (privacy, authentication, notifications), using a lightweight realtime database. It'll resemble a chat app but will nominally be a collaborative outliner tool. For meeting notes ([[rethinking-media.better-meetings]]) and such.
