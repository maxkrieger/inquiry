- It's a case against "localities" (sections) of the brain: https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/behrmannlab/Publications/BehrmannPlautTiCS2013.pdf
- It's a robust explanation for consciousness (http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Multiple_drafts_model#Fame_in_the_brain)

- To an extent, it explains the concept of **mess**:
  - > Sarah Perry’s [Tendrils of Mess in our Brains](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/01/05/tendrils-of-mess-in-our-brains/). This is a sketch of a satisfying theory of what mess is: interference from multiple conflicting ordering principles

## Implications

- Singular focus is effective for work, but doesn't characterize many diffuse modes of thinking, comparing, qualia
  - UIs can present multitudes
 - Pattern completion effects mean that the right prime/hint is enough to anticipate the whole. Schemata are also crucial.
- Subtle behaviors like text selection are processed without consciousness - probably mostly wiring the motor and perceptual functions together - you’ll forget they exist until they’re wrong (a variant of Cunninghams law)
