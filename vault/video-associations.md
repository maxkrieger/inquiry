Inspired by my time at [Reduct](https://reduct.video) and [Rob Ochshorn's work](https://rmozone.com/).

From Glue discord:

> I wonder if there is a glue-y video navigation concept. not oral navigable timelines, and not tiktok/clips

> Deleuze did a lot of cinema work

> it would be sorta a hallucinatory recursive network of scene-bubbles dangling off each other like kinopio

> 4chan threads, images-only but more cyclical

> and then you can extract a range by scrubbing on the little bubble

Lots of VJing is just with signals. What about with actual content and associative metaphor.
