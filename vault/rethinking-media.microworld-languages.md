I loved Papert's Mindstorms. Part of why it resonated is simply because I like using programming to learn stuff. Not everyone likes that, but I think it's still worth exploring how domain specific languages can guide self-directed learning.

It's worth mentioning that Sam Ritchie already outlined, like, a lot of this, in [The Dynamic Notebook](https://roadtoreality.substack.com/p/the-dynamic-notebook) and his ongoing effort to port [SICM](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-classical-mechanics) there.

- I'm struck by the un-Haskell-ness of this api. https://reanimate.github.io/
  - you don't need to know the ins and outs of Haskell to use this "DSL"

#### Group theory

What would an algebraic environment look like? How would I encode and play with the circle group? The monster group? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_group
