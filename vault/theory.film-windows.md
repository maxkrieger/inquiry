[Sergei Eisenstein, sequences diagrams for Alexander Nevsky and Battleship PotÃ«mkin](https://socks-studio.com/2011/04/21/sergei-eisenstein-sequences-diagrams-for-alexander-nevsky-and-battleship-potemkin/)

Similar for comics, but over time.

When footage is cut into a video, you have a "desktop environment" that surfaces various materials over time to give you, the viewer, an understanding of the notions in the work. You of course don't manage the windows, that's the editor's job. But the best filmmaking makes you feel like you're somewhat in control, and answers/asks the questions for you, as they unravel, over time.

This is kinda true about slideshows as well/lectures. With the chalkboards that slide up and down.
