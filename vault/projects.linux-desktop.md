How beautiful would it be if people had to reuse old forgotten laptops, put linux on them, if they wanted to see the future of computing in action?

The future of computing isn't on a flashy laptop that came out last month. It's on the devices we forgot, that we can repurpose into new assemblages.

Make demand for old laptops by providing a radically different experience from your main machine. Something you reach for to have fun and create whimsical stuff.
