In the spirit of [alternative filesystems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfHpDDXJQVg) - the downloads folder is acutely in need of a different structure.

It has multiple roles - a temporary cache for saved stuff, a reading list, ...

It shouldn't homogenize every file into the same old stack.

Where would it live? On mac, maybe the menubar? You can't replace finder, can you?

Would be a great addition to Alfred.
