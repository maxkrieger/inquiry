Low fi spaced repetition of things you’ve seen before. Links people have sent. Talks you last saw years ago.

A general purpose program that hooks into slack, discord, twitter, gdocs and resurfaces messages based on some strategy. RTing someone who stopped tweeting that you want to remember. Related content from years prior. Etc

Feed of fragments. Resurfacing toolkit finds nudges that provide a window into a larger stream of forgotten memories slowly moving along.
