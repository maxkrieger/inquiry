* The best book on a shelf/in an aisle
* The most esoteric / sci-fi sounding book
* The book with the most magical incantations
* Best phrase
* Best diagram
* Assemble a list of essential knowledge for a hypothetical society (foundation/post apocalyptic)
* Guess the title and subject of this book based on this page I'm showing you
* Guess the genre of a given shelf that you got blindfolded to go to

Coffee table books are great to read together, wide viewing angle

* need to mark book slot locations to put the books back



Need to google “things to do at the library”
