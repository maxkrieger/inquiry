It is rather absurd that we have to sacrifice our bodies' wellbeing while performing knowledge work, and make up for it through exercise.

We need pose literacy; a grammar that fuses the semantics of posture and tasks-at-hand. Like learning keyboard shortcuts, poses can be learned and composed for a more ergonomic experience in the digital world.

Furniture-driven software.

> I‚Äôm starting to see a glimpse of body aware computation systems that through physical posture promote feelings of safety and well-being

> On top of that I added lime green and purple yoga mats, bright orange bolsters, yoga blocks, and belts. (Yes the color matters, but I‚Äôll get back to that.) These props, and the ways we use them, come from restorative and yin yoga. Restorative yoga is an approach to yoga asanas (poses) which works directly with the nervous system, promoting feelings of safety and security by supporting every joint in the body and using verbal cues to encourage deep relaxation. Yin yoga uses the same poses but with different emphasis. The goal in yin is to elongate connective tissue. Connective tissue is everything from bones to joint capsules to the honeycomb of endomysium which surrounds and gives structure to every muscle cell in a vast continuous network. Unlike the muscle fibers themselves which are elastic (bounce-baFck-fulness) connective tissue is plastic (stretch-ableness) which means that it will change shape with any low intensity, long duration position. You are already doing connective tissue modifying things everyday. If you use a laptop or phone you are familiar with hunch pose. Long exposures accentuate the kyphotic curve in upper spine (rounding the shoulders and ribs forward) and the lordodic curve in the neck (jutting the head forward). Blech. [...]

> Ok Now we have covered the floor, the props, and the bodies let‚Äôs zoom out to the larger room then zoom in to software.

> The floor you are on, the furniture you use, the design of the software, but also where you wear influences the experience you have in a headset. Where and how our VR play space is situated was inspired half by necessity and half by the ‚Äòwomb with a view‚Äô concept from home design I learned from Winifred Gallagher‚Äôs book House Thinking (Thanks Margaret for the recommendation!). Gallagher describes a framework for building living spaces that ‚Äúimprove[s] our lives and perhaps even our mental health‚Äù by balancing 5 components: prospect, refuge, enticement, peril, and complex order. If they can make a home feel homier why can‚Äôt they make a studio feel safe and playful? Safe-at-home is exactly the feeling a VR space needs because as Gallagher points out ‚ÄúSafe at home, we even enjoy perilous heights and pay extra for dramatic views, balconies, and staircases to prove it.‚Äù VR‚Äôs perilous heights included.

> But while all these changes in environment and furniture and behavior can dramatically improve the experience of wearing, it must be met by software designed for the same union of mobility and stability. It‚Äôs this environment, not the swively present, ya‚Äôll should be testing in. A simple example: What makes the Youtube Daydream app better than the Netflix one? Youtube enables users to position the focal point anywhere. Netflix choose a fixed focal point that can‚Äôt accommodate many of these postures. It‚Äôs haunted by the specter of that swivel chair. Fixed focal point is üìÇdesktop metaphor, the old way. Variable focal point is üé®studio metaphor, the new way.

I love the foam blocks+yoga mat language. I'm wondering how peripherals like VESA monitors or mice fit into the mix. Magnetic mounting might work. Could make a bunch of magnetic surfaces on those blocks (facing downwards, sideways) to stick a tablet to.

There's a severe lack of on-body/portable input methods. And objects that are blobby and non-orientable, where you can use them at their corners or centers.

Kinda want to make one of [these](https://muca.cc/resources/create-skin) but in a disc shape. Could work well with iPad cursor behavior.
