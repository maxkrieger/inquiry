There's a massive shortage of DevOps people right now, and you don't need much of a CS background to be a good DevOps engineer.

Why is it so hard right now to become one?

- Lack of situated contexts to practice devops
  - Need more minecraft servers
- Complexity, incidental and intentional
- YAML sucks
- AWS is enormous - they have their own certification program

** Are guided sandboxes the solution? **
** What do DevOps interview questions look like? **
