Update: Someone did this for k8s! https://eric-jadi.medium.com/minecraft-as-a-k8s-admin-tool-cf16f890de42

[Dark](https://darklang.com/) makes REST apis pretty easy. [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html) did a fine job too.

Ok so why can't we do it using Minecraft's metaphors: paper notes as request file descriptors. Logs as books. Chests as databases. Hoppers as routes.

Minskyâ€™s afterword of True Names talks about how virtual worlds are symbolic metaphor environments. You can work in computational spaces by building up a language of symbols that map to other familiar symbols. His most striking claim: our conscious mind is already a symbolic virtual world. Our thoughts are all material/concrete/symbolic interfaces to the more abstract neural structures we have.

Minecraft chests are a lot like a google sheet, they're [[hyper observable|theory.hyper-observable]].
