A learning environment/[[theory.ide-for-x]]/reasoning environment for relational algebra (similar to [[projects.linear-algebra-spreadsheet]]).

Eg what does this look like in a UI? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(relational_algebra)

Is this just SQL or...?

Would it look like Natto?

Would it look like UML?
