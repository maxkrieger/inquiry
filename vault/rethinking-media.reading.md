Reading [Why books don't work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) was like glancing at my bucket of liquid ambrosia and realizing it was full of holes. "Wait... I can't remember everything I've read?". Well, at least I can still [signal on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61849534-max-krieger). Andy focuses on memory, which is great because my ambrosia bucket needs its holes plugged. In the meantime I want to explore other dimensions of reading.
