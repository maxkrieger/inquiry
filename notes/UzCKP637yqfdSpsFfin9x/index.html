<p>I want to build tools for important problems. Some of the most important problems are being tackled in academic biology labs. They seem like a suitable <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Effective_system_design_requires_insights_drawn_from_serious_contexts_of_use">serious context of use</a> to invent powerful new representations and tools and help improve public health.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sashachapin/status/1453423907898232836?s=21">https://twitter.com/sashachapin/status/1453423907898232836?s=21</a></p>
<p>I'm considering reaching out to bio labs across the country and volunteering (for a small stipend) to be a "resident toolbuilder". Not just to solve immediate digital problems for the lab but to examine and improve their processes and accessibility for everyone. Perhaps down the road I can generalize one lab's tooling into a more universal platform (<a href="/inquiry/notes/c3d1d432-1ebd-4805-8a16-a0eadfcaf329">Figma for Science</a>).</p>
<p>Two caveats to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "faster horse" problem: will labs be biased towards conventional tools and just want me to do plumbing? Assuming plumbing is actually the biggest bottleneck, maybe I can do something to improve productivity there. Do they even know what they need in general? It would be best if I could observe (a la <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691028323/laboratory-life">Laboratory Life</a>) what they're doing and act from there, using my own imagination.</li>
<li>Accruing technical debt: I don't want to leave the lab in more of a mess than it started, with rapidly-rotting bespoke frontends that will end up in the trash quickly. Ideally I build an oeuvre that is either very easy for the lab to maintain, or is so cohesive and compelling that I can maintain it myself as a "platform".</li>
</ul>
<p>In general I'm becoming more biased in favor of building for "hard tech" for urgent problems in the world (I resonated with <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2021_01_important_work/">Kevin Lynagh's post</a> on important work). Effective altruism is another realm I'm adjacent to and very much a supporter of.</p>
<p>I incidentally discovered <a href="https://postlight.com/podcast/computing-is-everywhere">Bret Victor considered</a> going this route early in his career:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw climate change as this crisis and one of the most important things to work on. And I’d — I’d tried to work directly on that in certain ways and realized that I just didn’t really have the kind of temperment for going really deep on a scientific problem. I was more of a toolmaker. I wanted to make tools that enabled other people to rally other people in the problem. Even before Apple I had come up with this plan of, “Well, I wanna make this really powerful scientific tool. I don’t really know enough of how science is practiced. And so I’m going to like travel around the country, spending a month at a different scie — a different lab um every month. Just kind of offering myself as like, “I’m a free toolmaker, use me how you will.” And then thereby kind of get — get the experience of um after a year of like, “Oh here’s the sorts of needs that scientists have and here is the super tool that I can make.” That plan didn’t really get off the ground because um it turns out I’m not really social enough to reach out to people actively like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I went through this period of traveling around and kind of coming up with these themes. But in the process of doing that, I uh — a team of scientists at um at Georgia Tech and um did some prototyping with them. And the structures that I came up with and the enthusiasm that they had for them made me think, kinda go back to that, “Hey, I really wanna make a tool for scientists. I wanna make a new MatLab or a cross between MatLab and Garageband.” And so that was um I’ve never admitted this publicly before but that was kind of my — my major project for like the next year or two after that was I was making this um this new scientific tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to have the level of motivation to pull off something really huge like that, if you don’t have the right support structures in place.</p>
